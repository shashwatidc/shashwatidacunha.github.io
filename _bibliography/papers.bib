	abstract = {Blinking, the transient occlusion of the eye by one or more membranes, serves several functions including wetting, protecting, and cleaning the eye. This behavior is seen in nearly all living tetrapods and absent in other extant sarcopterygian lineages suggesting that it might have arisen during the water-to-land transition. Unfortunately, our understanding of the origin of blinking has been limited by a lack of known anatomical correlates of the behavior in the fossil record and a paucity of comparative functional studies. To understand how and why blinking originates, we leverage mudskippers (Oxudercinae), a clade of amphibious fishes that have convergently evolved blinking. Using microcomputed tomography and histology, we analyzed two mudskipper species,
              Periophthalmus barbarus
              and
              Periophthalmodon septemradiatus
              , and compared them to the fully aquatic round goby,
              Neogobius melanostomus
              . Study of gross anatomy and epithelial microstructure shows that mudskippers have not evolved novel musculature or glands to blink. Behavioral analyses show the blinks of mudskippers are functionally convergent with those of tetrapods:
              P. barbarus
              blinks more often under high-evaporation conditions to wet the eye, a blink reflex protects the eye from physical insult, and a single blink can fully clean the cornea of particulates. Thus, eye retraction in concert with a passive occlusal membrane can achieve functions associated with life on land. Osteological correlates of eye retraction are present in the earliest limbed vertebrates, suggesting blinking capability. In both mudskippers and tetrapods, therefore, the origin of this multifunctional innovation is likely explained by selection for increasingly terrestrial lifestyles.},

	abstract = {Chemical kinetics and reaction engineering consists of the phenomenological framework for the disentanglement of reaction mechanisms, optimization of reaction performance and the rational design of chemical processes. Here, we utilize feed-forward artificial neural networks as basis functions to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) constrained by differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that describe microkinetic models (MKMs). We present an algebraic framework for the mathematical description and classification of reaction networks, types of elementary reaction, and chemical species. Under this framework, we demonstrate that the simultaneous training of neural nets and kinetic model parameters in a regularized multi-objective optimization setting leads to the solution of the inverse problem through the estimation of kinetic parameters from synthetic experimental data. We analyze a set of scenarios to establish the extent to which kinetic parameters can be retrieved from transient kinetic data, and assess the robustness of the methodology with respect to statistical noise. This approach to inverse kinetic ODEs can assist in the elucidation of reaction mechanisms based on transient data.},

	abstract = {To integrate electrochemical CO2 reduction into the chemicals industry at scale, the outlet streams from CO2 electrolyzers must be product rich. Single-pass conversion is becoming increasingly common as a performance benchmark for CO2 electrolyzers because it suggests concentrated products and reduced separation energy for many catalytic processes. However, our analysis shows that CO2R reactor configurations that maximize single-pass conversion currently suffer from low product concentration in the outlet stream. This is because they restrict CO2 flow or operate in acidic cathode environments, which promote considerable hydrogen evolution as a side reaction. For any gas products besides syngas, high single-pass conversion does not signify that separation energy losses have been eliminated, or that product streams are directly suitable as feedstocks for downstream processes. We therefore recommend that researchers targeting CO2R scaleup report product concentrations rather than relying on single-pass conversion as an indicator of overall performance. Maximizing product concentration is a more meaningful target than maximizing single-pass conversion.},
