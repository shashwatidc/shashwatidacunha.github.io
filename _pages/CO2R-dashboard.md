## Interactive techno-economic assessment for CO<sub>2</sub>R

Use my CO<sub>2</sub> reduction costing dashboard to interactively explore the capital and operating costs of CO<sub>2</sub>R in a membrane electrode assembly process. The model is physics-informed, so there is an integrated model of electrolyzer physics and chemistry under the hood. This is an interactive tool based on my publication:
> Da Cunha, S.; Resasco, J. Insights from Techno-Economic Analysis Can Guide the Design of Low-Temperature CO₂ Electrolyzers towards Industrial Scaleup; preprint; ChemRxiv, 2024. DOI: [10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-g76xl](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-g76xl)
